I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan where I am co-advised by Tom Wenisch and Ron Dreslinski. My research is primarily on software systems for visual analytics: developing frameworks and techniques at scale to leverage existing computer vision models and kernels. I am currently working on a project funded by the ADA (Applications Driving Architectures) Center, previously having worked on projects funded by Toyota Research Institute and ARM. I interned at ARM three times, once with the CPU Engineering group (working on what became the Cortex-A76) and twice with the High Performance Computing Research group.

I am a strong proponent of computer science education for all, having taught at the high school through graduate school level. I recently served as a primary instructor for the undergraduate computer architecture class (EECS 370) at Michigan, and my paper on teaching out-of-order RISC-V core design as a capstone undergraduate course (EECS 470) was published at SIGCSE '21.
